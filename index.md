# 📚 JustAGuyLinux Wiki

Welcome to JustAGuyLinux, where the motto is "Not an expert. Just A Guy." 😅 

This wiki is automatically synced from our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/drewgrif/docs.justaguylinux.com/wiki) and provides easy-to-follow documentation and guides for everyday Linux users.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Use the sidebar navigation to browse topics, or check out these popular sections:

- **🏠 Homelab**: Server setup, self-hosting, and infrastructure
- **💻 Software**: Application guides and configurations  
- **🐳 Docker**: Container setup and management
- **☁️ Nextcloud**: Self-hosted cloud solutions
- **🎥 YouTube**: Video summaries and tutorials

## 🤔 Why JustAGuy Linux?

- **Expertise**: I like to think of myself as "just some random" that loves to tinker. Eternally learning right alongside you!
- **Clarity**: My goal is to explain things in a simple way so that even someone without a technical background, like me, can understand and explain them easily.
- **Community**: I'm a regular on [The Linux Cast 🎙️](https://thelinuxcast.org) podcast and hang out on [Discord 💬](https://discord.gg/C9je3KSrFA).

## 📜 About This Documentation

Ever wish you had a guide that explains Linux without making you feel like you need a PhD in computer science? Look no further! I seriously don't have a clue... most of the time. My goal is to provide documentation that's clear, helpful, and occasionally useful.

## 🎥📝 YouTube Video Notes

Struggling to remember what you watched on that 30-minute video? (Me too) I'm making an effort to offer concise summaries so you don't have to replay the entire thing. Working on making this a regular commitment.
