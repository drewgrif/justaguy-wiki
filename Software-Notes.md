# Notes

The objection about syncing can be eliminated if you are using Nextcloud Desktop OR 
A Git repo for notes that you manually sync.


### **2. Neovim with `iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim` (8.4)**  
Neovim, paired with the **markdown-preview.nvim** plugin, offers a highly customizable, efficient markdown editing experience. Ideal for users who prefer command-line tools and have a comfort level with Vim-style editing. The live preview functionality in the browser, along with the power of plugins like **Telescope** and **Treesitter**, makes it a powerful choice for advanced users. However, it requires setup and a steeper learning curve compared to more GUI-based editors.

### **4. Iotas (7.9)**  
Iotas offers a modern, simple interface with markdown support and focuses on lightweight note organization. It's great for basic markdown writing, but lacks advanced features like backlinks or graph views that some other note-taking apps offer.

!!! Note
	A gnome application.  Easy to install via Flathub


### **6. Apostrophe (7.5)**  
Apostrophe provides a clean, distraction-free writing experience, with full markdown support and a live preview. It's great for writers but lacks more advanced features like task management and note linking that would make it more powerful for complex note-taking.

!!! Note
	GTK application but does not take on the style.  Weird. No tabs.


### **8. MarkText (7.2)**  
MarkText has a clean and user-friendly interface with live preview, making it easy for users to edit markdown documents. However, it lacks advanced features like backlinks, and it's no longer actively maintained, which could lead to stability issues over time.


### **10. QOwnNotes (5.8)**  
QOwnNotes supports markdown and integrates with Nextcloud for syncing, but its outdated UI and limited features make it less attractive compared to other tools. Its lack of mobile support and occasional syncing issues with Nextcloud are notable drawbacks.

!!! Note
	QT application - not a fan


### **11. Logseq (5.0)**  
Logseq is an outliner-based tool that focuses on hierarchical note-taking and knowledge management. Itâ€™s a unique approach, but its steep learning curve, clunky UI, and performance issues with larger notes make it a less practical option for many users.
